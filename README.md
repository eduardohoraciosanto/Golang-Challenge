This is my solution to the Golang Challenge.  

There are two folders, each for its own exercise.

*Note: In this exercise I didn't reached 100% coverage because on my tests I haven't used all the posible cases for my interface implementation. I also didn't covered the case where the-friend-of-the-friend was not available in the UserRepository.*
